/*
 * Selection sort is based on the following idea:
 *
 * Selecting the largest array element and swapping it with the last array element leaves an
 * unsorted list whose size is 1 less than the size of the original list.
 * If we repeat this step again on the unsorted list we have an ordered list
 * of size 2 and an unordered lsit size n-2.
 * When we repeat this until the size of the unsorted list becomes 1, the result will be a sorted list.
 *
 * Write a program to implement this algorithm.
