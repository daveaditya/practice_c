 * Write a program that requests for a file name and an integer, known as offset value.
 * The program then reads teh file starting from the location specified by the offset value
 * and prints the contents on the screen.
 *
 * Note: if the offset value is a positive integer, then printing skips that
 * many lines, If it is a negative number, it prints that many lines from the
 * end of the file. An appropriate error message should be printed, if anything goes wrong.
