 * Create two structures named metric and British which store the values of

 * and the British structure stores the values in feet and inches. Write a
 * program that reads values for the structure variables and adds values contained
 * in one variable of metric to the contents of another variable of British. The
 * program should display the result in the format of feet and inches or metres
 * and centimetres as required.
