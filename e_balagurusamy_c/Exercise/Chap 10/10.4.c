/*
 * Define a structure data type named date containing three integer members day, month
 * and year. Develop an inetractive modular program to perform the following tasks:
 * a. To read data into structure members by a function
 * b. Ti validate the date entered by another function
 * c. To print date in the format	April 29, 2002 		by a third function
 * The input data should be three integers like 29,4,2002 corresponding to
 * day, month and year. Examples of valid data:
 * 31,4,2002 - April has only 30 days
 * 29,2,2002 - 2002 is not a leap year.
