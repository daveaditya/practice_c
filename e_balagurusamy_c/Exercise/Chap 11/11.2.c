/*
 * We know that the roots of a quadratic equation of the form 	ax^2 + bx + c = 0
 * are given by the following equations:
 * x1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)
 * x2 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)
 * Write a funciton to calculate the roots.
 * The function must use two pointer parameters, one to receive teh coefficients a, b and c,
 * and the other to send the roots to the calling function.
