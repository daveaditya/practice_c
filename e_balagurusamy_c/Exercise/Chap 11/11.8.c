/*
 * Given an array of sorted list of integer numbers, write a function to search for
 * a particular item, using the method of binary search. And also show how this function
 * may be used in a program. Use pointers and pointer arithmetic.
 *
 * (Hint: In binary search the target value is compared with the array's middle
 * element. Since the table is sorted, if the required the value if saller, we know that
 * all values greater than the middle element can be ignored. That is, in one
 * attempt, we eliminate one half the list. This search can be applied recursively till
 * the target value if found.)
